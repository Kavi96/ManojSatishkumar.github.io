                    class="card-text"> Today I will address one of the sensitive things that are still being followed in
                    few
                    software companies - "Asking the previous employer payslips before sending offer letter"
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are 2 reasons for asking it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To verify if the candidate is not faking experience.</li>
                        <li>To determine their hike.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    I'm totally OK with the first one.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But the second reason separates "Great" companies from "OKish" companies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Let me explain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Companies already have certain baselines and slabs of CTC predefined for a given role. I
                    understand negotiation is an art. But deciding the starting CTC based on previous
                    employer salary is something we should reconsider whether to continue doing or not.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When you ask a selected candidate about his/her expectation, most candidates will say
                    "Industry standard". This is because they value the company overall and believe that the
                    standards are high and on par with the market.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After this, the moment previous employer payslips are asked, it could damage the
                    reputation a bit.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Just a thought.
                    <br />
                    I'm just trying to express the impact of this sensitive thing.

                    I remember someone commenting on my previous post.
                    <br />
                    "A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle" - It hit me hard.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Every day when you wake up, ask yourself the below question.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If I had a billion dollars in my bank account, what would I do today? If I was the top 1% in the
                    world, what would I do today?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                        You end up with 2 options.
                    </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1. Am I going to spend it carelessly?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. Am I going to help someone grow?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Guess what, if you have chosen the second option, there is no need to wait to become a billionaire.
                    You can get started right now.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Help has many forms. One type of help is monetary. Another type of help is "Lighting another
                    candle".
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    "Lighting another candle" - is a kind of help where you sell your experience for free. You might
                    have gained so much experience in a certain aspect. Give that for free. You will essentially be a
                    philanthropist.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The ultimate feeling in life is "personal-satisfaction".
                    <br />
                    Not pleasure.

                    class="card-text">
                    With most companies moving to WFH model, interviews over video conferencing have become the only
                    option lately. The world has changed and we software developers love "change" because we have been
                    told that's the only "constant" in our career.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below are 3 tips you must keep in mind before the interview starts. I assume you have prepared well
                    before this day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#1. Join the call on time and turn the webcam ON.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - By turning the webcam ON, you get immediately noticed as most candidates and interviewers will not
                    turn it on. They will focus on you a bit more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#2. Keep your favorite code editor handy.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - Few companies will prefer an online editor. But many times, the interviewer may ask you to open in
                    your local machine due to VPN issues. Don't waste time installing it. Keep it ready.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#3. Keep a sample project ready.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - The last thing you want is getting stuck in setting up a sample project. Don't waste time
                    installing dependencies. Keep the sample project ready where you can quickly code and show the
                    output. If you are in a react.js interview, keep a" hello world" app ready with index.js
                    <br />

                    ü§Ø React's useEffect( ) is more powerful than I thought.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many react developers got a taste of "hooks" last year and ever since, it has been hard to go back
                    to class components. I mean, who wants those life cycle methods.. yukkk üò™
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The very first hook that we learnt was obviously "useState ( )" which allowed us to maintain an
                    internal state for a given react function component.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    üë®‚Äçüíª const [ state, setState ] = useState(initialValue);
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We loved ‚ù§Ô∏è the performance it brought as redux state updates are comparatively slower. When I fire
                    a redux action to update the state, I always felt the lag üëé if I am using that state to render a
                    certain UI component. ( Like opening and closing a Material UI drawer at a rapid rate. Browser
                    freezes after a while ). The last thing I want on my website is a browser freeze üò°
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But it's always fast with the component's local state üòá
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The second hook we learnt is useEffect ( );
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    useEffect(() => {
                    <br />
                    // Your code
                    <br />
                    }, [variables]);
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Turns out, this is not just for executing some side effect code. It can control the app UX with so
                    much minimal code üò≤

                    I observed a newbie who joined a startup looking happier than a Senior director working at
                    Microsoft.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When I examined this a little bit, I come to realize many things.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Apparently our inner feeings about our profession depends on the difference between what we want and
                    what we have gained in our professional career.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The desires of the newbie are so far less that the arithmetic difference yields a numerically
                    positive result of the above thought equation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Rewind back even more in life and you can see a 3 year old child playing in sand looked full of
                    happiness spilling everywhere he went.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As we grow up, if we can balance the above arithmetic difference and control our desires, I think
                    the feeling can be sustained.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I don't have any proof for this.
                    <br />
                    Just thought of sharing anyway.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope I don't get any message from Senior directors at Microsoft üòÖ

                    When I was in college, I thought I will be successful if I can get 1st rank.
                    <br />I got it finally but I realized late how selfish of a thought it really was.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When I was in college, I thought I will be successful if I can get into one of the top 5 companies
                    in the world.
                    <br /> But now I realized late how selfish of a thought it really was.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    At this point,
                    <br />I stopped thinking about a new thing again because its apparent that success is not measured
                    by what I become in life. Success is measured by what I enable others to become in their lives.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So correction of history is not possible now due to the laws of physics but atleast future is in my
                    control.

                    <br />
                    I will keep spreading the information and knowledge I have gained when it comes to software
                    development, technology and life in general to my followers for free.

                    I hope my past classmates forgive me for what I've done and big thanks to Sadhguru JV for making me
                    realise it early before I reach 30 years of age. You have done wonders for next generation students

                    <br/>I request Indian software engineers from Google , Facebook , Amazon , Apple , Microsoft , Adobe , Oracle , Salesforce , Reliance Retail , Reliance Jio , and other major tech companies to take a day off and look at your LinkedIn chat messages and imagine yourself in a situation asking for that 1 referral you dream to get a reply for.

                    Passionate individuals might be missing out on opportunities they deserve and companies might miss them out in search of well settled talent.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#confession</strong>
                    <br/>Although I admit I could not reply to every single candidate looking for an opportunity in my organisation due to the sheer number of chats. But please don't feel bad and I'm sorry about it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is my duty to refer deserving talent and I will. Because once upon a time, I was in the same boat as you waiting for days and months.

                    Sometimes, those in need can go far above and beyond than those who already have well paid jobs and prove to be worthy assets to the company.
