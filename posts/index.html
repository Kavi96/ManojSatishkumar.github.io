                    class="card-text"> Today I will address one of the sensitive things that are still being followed in
                    few
                    software companies - "Asking the previous employer payslips before sending offer letter"
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    There are 2 reasons for asking it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To verify if the candidate is not faking experience.</li>
                        <li>To determine their hike.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    I'm totally OK with the first one.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But the second reason separates "Great" companies from "OKish" companies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Let me explain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Companies already have certain baselines and slabs of CTC predefined for a given role. I
                    understand negotiation is an art. But deciding the starting CTC based on previous
                    employer salary is something we should reconsider whether to continue doing or not.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When you ask a selected candidate about his/her expectation, most candidates will say
                    "Industry standard". This is because they value the company overall and believe that the
                    standards are high and on par with the market.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After this, the moment previous employer payslips are asked, it could damage the
                    reputation a bit.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Just a thought.
                    <br />
                    I'm just trying to express the impact of this sensitive thing.

                    I remember someone commenting on my previous post.
                    <br />
                    "A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle" - It hit me hard.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Every day when you wake up, ask yourself the below question.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If I had a billion dollars in my bank account, what would I do today? If I was the top 1% in the
                    world, what would I do today?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>
                        You end up with 2 options.
                    </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1. Am I going to spend it carelessly?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            2. Am I going to help someone grow?
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Guess what, if you have chosen the second option, there is no need to wait to become a billionaire.
                    You can get started right now.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Help has many forms. One type of help is monetary. Another type of help is "Lighting another
                    candle".
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    "Lighting another candle" - is a kind of help where you sell your experience for free. You might
                    have gained so much experience in a certain aspect. Give that for free. You will essentially be a
                    philanthropist.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The ultimate feeling in life is "personal-satisfaction".
                    <br />
                    Not pleasure.

                <div style="padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; background-color:  #e7e7e7; color: black; font-size: medium;"
                    class="card-text">
                    With most companies moving to WFH model, interviews over video conferencing have become the only
                    option lately. The world has changed and we software developers love "change" because we have been
                    told that's the only "constant" in our career.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below are 3 tips you must keep in mind before the interview starts. I assume you have prepared well
                    before this day.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#1. Join the call on time and turn the webcam ON.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - By turning the webcam ON, you get immediately noticed as most candidates and interviewers will not
                    turn it on. They will focus on you a bit more.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#2. Keep your favorite code editor handy.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - Few companies will prefer an online editor. But many times, the interviewer may ask you to open in
                    your local machine due to VPN issues. Don't waste time installing it. Keep it ready.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>#3. Keep a sample project ready.</strong>
                    <br />
                    - The last thing you want is getting stuck in setting up a sample project. Don't waste time
                    installing dependencies. Keep the sample project ready where you can quickly code and show the
                    output. If you are in a react.js interview, keep a" hello world" app ready with index.js
                    <br />
