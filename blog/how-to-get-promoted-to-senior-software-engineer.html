                    for review and doesn't hold the tester/validation engineer accountable for a defective released
                    product. The senior engineer willingly fixes the defect that is found by the tester and takes an
                    extra mile ensuring the integrity of the application/product.</span><br />

                          If you are looking forward to becoming a senior engineer, get the mindset of taking up more
                          responsibilities. Life ain't easy. It only gets harder. But as we grow in any industry, our
                          skills get evolved as well and we tend to uplift ourselves to senior positions.<br />
                          We need to keep evolving cuz that's what life is all about. We take newer, harder challenges
                          and achieve them. Once we achieve them, we get that personal satisfaction. Once we get
                          personal satisfaction, we will be ready for the next level.<br />
