              <div>
                Have you ever wondered how you can save time? Let me ask you a different question, Have you ever spent
                time to actually think about saving time? Well, it looks like time is the most valuable asset that we
                all have in our lives. And yet we spend it without thinking. Think about this. Do you spend money
                without thinking? Then why would you spend time?
                <br />
                <br />
                Time spent not doing productive things is as good as losing money. Because time actually evaluates to
                the number of assets you obtain in your life. Spend time wisely to accumulate wealth. Spending less time
                on various things can help you get time to maintain your health. Health is really important in our
                lives. If you lose health, you lose everything.
                <br />
                <br />
                Successful people all over the world have their own tricks to save time. You see, you can’t be really
                successful if you're doing repetitive tasks every day. You have to find those little hacks that save
                time. When you do, you actually end up doing a lot more productive work than you will ever imagine.
                <br />
                <br />
                For instance, if you take all of the texting that you do on a daily basis and convert them to keyboard
                shortcuts, you will end up saving a lot of time. Time is wealth. Time is health as wealth.
                <br />
                <br />
                Multitasking is really useful. I'm not denying it. But multitasking on a daily basis too much can
                actually reduce your productivity. There are some things that you want to multitask but there're other
                things you don't want to.
                <br />
                <br />
                For example, you want to listen to music and an audiobook perhaps while you do exercise in the gym. But
                you don't want to constantly check emails when you're programming or doing some task that requires
                continuous focus. You don't want to constantly chit chat with your colleagues when you're doing actual
                core work in the office.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Another example,
                <br />
                <br />
                You would want to read a book when you're travelling in a taxi. But you don't want to just Facebook or
                listen to songs when you're travelling for four hours. In various metro cities, if you really think,
                you’re actually spending more time travelling. And so, you want to save time and do multitasking in
                times like these. You could read a book about increasing productivity or a book about personal finance
                during this non-productive trip. You could also do some coding if you are programmer during this time.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another way to boost your productivity is by utilising speech to text recognition software's in Mac,
                Windows and other operating systems.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you're using a Mac or an Apple device, Siri can help you save a ton of time translating all your
                speech into text. Whether it be a writing a blog post or just jotting down some notes, you can always
                use speech to text recognition to do things for you. This actually saves time because you could never
                type as fast as you speak for most of you out there. Some people actually blame Siri for not being very
                accurate but this is a very useful feature provided by Siri and I found it to be extremely accurate in
                this area. In fact, this entire blog post is not written. I am speaking and Siri is writing it for me.
                After the entire post is written. I will just cross-check if there are any errors and correct them.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you're on the Mac, you can also save time by automating tasks. There's a building tool and Mac and
                it's called the Automator. Automator can do a ton of work for you when you're not using the Mac. You can
                open multiple websites at once. You can run a bunch of bash commands. You can even open multiple apps at
                once. Configure Automator with voice narration, you'll be able to do all this just by talking to your
                Mac. It is one of those powerful tools I found to be very useful when I want to take brakes, save time
                and rest for a while when my eyes are strained due to work.
                <br />
                <br />
                In one of the future blog posts, I will show you how Automator can get all the routine tasks done
                without even you touching the keyboard.
                <br />
                <br />
                You should also avoid working for very long hours. Try doing this the next time. Work for 25 minutes and
                take a break for 5 minutes. Continue is for one full day and compare your productivity with the previous
                day. If you have seen improvement in your productivity then comment on this blog post and tell me how.
