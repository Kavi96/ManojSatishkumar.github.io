              If you are here, you probably have decided to change your company due to a certain reason but you're still
              not sure whether you want to make this move or not. You are still asking yourself whether you should
              re-consider staying in your current company. Yes, I understand what you're going through. I've gone
              through it too and I had to take a few decisions that have helped me in my career so far. Keep reading and
              hopefully, you can make a decision in the end.
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">If you thought about this, you would have thought of changing your job because of these
                  reasons :</span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>Reason #5 : You are probably influenced by others</b></span></h4>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">So you come to know that some of your co-workers left your company and joined somewhere
                  else. If they are a bit closer to you, you would have probably asked them where did they join, why
                  they
                  left your company and what is their new pay scale. This is very common behavior and it happens with
                  all of
                  us. But after inquiring all these details, when you come to know about the benefits that they got
                  after
                  joining the new company, you sometimes felt that you are missing out on certain
                  opportunities.&nbsp;</span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>How to overcome this problem?</b></span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">The first thing that you want to do is to stop comparing yourself with others. The more
                  you
                  compare yourself with others the more you want to become them. It could be that they are actually
                  lying to
                  you and trying to cover up with a certain situation or they are just trying to influence you and also
                  want
                  you to leave the company as well. They could've got a low salary increase and they just don't want to
                  let
                  you know. Even if they are very close to you people don't let go off their personal things outside
                  especially when it comes their professionalism so enquire once and do not take a decision
                  immediately.<br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>Reason #4 : You are deciding due to a recent bad situation</b></span></h4>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">Maybe you would have decided to leave your current company because you think that a
                  recent
                  happening in your company with you is not good. You might have had a hard conversation with your
                  manager
                  or you might have fought with your colleagues which has led to this decision. You could've taken
                  things
                  personally where they shouldn't have been. So you went home and you start thinking if it will be
                  better to
                  leave this company and join another company.</span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>How to overcome this problem?</b></span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">Running away from a problem or leaving the existing company may not be the solution all
                  the
                  time. You will never know what kind of situations could arise in the new company. Maybe you will run
                  across the same set of situations again. Or maybe the situations can even get worse. You cannot
                  predict
                  what it's going to happen in the future. Even if the new company is very good and it is paying you
                  really
                  well you will not know what kind of situations can cause you to lose your peace. If you have decided
                  to
                  leave your company because of fighting with your manager you might get an even worse manager the
                  future.
                  So don't&nbsp;decide&nbsp;immediately after a bad situation. Instead, go home think about it and come
                  the
                  other day with your decision.<br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>Reason #3 : You just want more salary</b></span></h4>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">Like I mentioned earlier you might have seen your colleagues leaving your company in
                  the
                  interest of the higher pay scale given by another company. You then realize that the current pay scale
                  that you are getting from your current company is not enough for your lifestyle. You just want to live
                  a
                  better life and you want to increase your lifestyle limits and expenses. The more money you have the
                  more
                  things you can buy. This is also one of the reasons or side effects which I mentioned earlier.<br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br /></span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>How to overcome this problem?</b></span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">You might want to calculate the amount of money you need versus the amount of money you
                  want. Maybe you don't need that much money to be happy. Is happiness the priority to you or money. Is
                  your
                  current company giving you enough money so that you're happy?&nbsp; If the answer is yes then there's
                  no
                  need to change your job or your company. You just wanted it but you don't really need it. If you
                  really
                  want to earn more money there other ways to do so. You can start your own blog or you can do a little
                  bit
                  of freelancing. This will also ensure that you get an additional income without changing your
                  job.<br />
                </span></div>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><br />
                </span></div>
              <h4 style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1"><b>Reason #2 : You are tired of the management</b></span></h4>
              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">You might not be a liking the way your manager behaves with you. You just don't like
                  the
                  leadership decisions that they make. You were never able to get along with your manager. You probably
                  want
                  to become an individual contributor. But your company is not giving you the role of an individual
                  contributor. So you decided to move on and change your company.<br />

              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">Ask your self the question why you are tired of the management. Is it that the
                  management
                  is targeting you or it is just your opinion. Maybe you want to recalculate or re-assess your
                  performance.
                  Ask yourself the question if you really have a way to get along with your current management. Is it
                  good
                  for your career if you change and become an individual contributor. Once you answer these questions
                  I'm
                  sure that you will find a way to get along. I'm not asking you to agree to whatever they say. I'm just
                  asking you to listen to yourself and try to find a way to manage your management. Your management will
                  listen to you and award you with the opportunities that you need.<br />

              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">So you're not satisfied with your work. It could be because you are working on an
                  outdated
                  project or it could be because you're just working in a technology that is not relevant anymore. You
                  want
                  to be on pace with the latest and greatest technologies out there. You see your friends working on the
                  super latest technologies and you ask yourself questions are you getting behind ? You also start to
                  think
                  about certain things that you don't like in your current workplace and you want to change your
                  job.<br />

              <div class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
                <span class="s1">If technology is the only reason you might want to check if there are other ways to
                  learn
                  these technologies. Maybe you can learn the cutting edge technology and implementing your current
                  project.
                  Ask yourself the question is anything stopping you from implementing these latest technologies in the
                  project that you're working in your current company. Is the project really getting out dated? . Can
                  you do
                  something about it. Can you prove to the management that you can uplift this project into the latest
                  technologies. If the answer is yes I would highly recommend that you do so and stay in your current
                  company. Bringing a change in the company elevates your career. People start looking up to you as an
                  expert. You not only feel better but you will get more opportunities in the future. You will find that
                  satisfaction you needed in your current job.</span></div>

                  there
                  are reasons not to quit the job. What if something else is bothering you and it is not allowing you to
                  live a peaceful life you probably might want to take a chance of switching the company. There's
                  absolutely
                  no harm in it. But it should be fruitful and it should be in right decision to make. There are a lot
