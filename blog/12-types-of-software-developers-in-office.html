              <br />
              In every Software IT company, you will come across certain coding animals called <b>"developers"</b> (pun
              intended).<br />
              <br />
              Developers are the ones that write code. The code that executes on a given machine and is meaningful in
              use. This is the code that is responsible for different applications / services that we use.<br />
              <br />
              If you are a software developer or if you want to become one, in a company you will encounter 12 different
              types of developers that you will interact with. You will come across these developers who have different
              qualities and they are inevitable. You cannot avoid them. You cannot work without them either.<br />
              <br />
              Let's see what type of developers you will encounter based on their behavior<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #1 : The Super developer&nbsp;</h3>
              This developer completes all the tasks within the given time. Sometimes the Super developer is the one who
              drives the whole project on their own.<br />
              <br />
              When you encounter the super developer, you will need to be well prepared before approaching
              him/her.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #2 : The Delegate developer</h3>
              This developer always keeps delegating the task / work given and always tries to make others work.<br />
              The delegate developer often doesn't want to do work on their own and they are often referred to as "lazy
              developer"<br />
              <br />
              If you encounter the Delegate developer, you will probably be delegated to another developer (the Super
              developer in most cases)<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #3 : The Show-off developer</h3>
              The Show-off developer always wants to impress the management and will always try to perform the tasks
              that have visibility to the management.<br />
              <br />
              If you see a developer always trying to present / prepare presentations / send update emails very
              often,&nbsp; you are probably interacting with a Show-off developer.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #4 : The Secret developer&nbsp;</h3>
              The secret developer is often very talented and will refuse to share what they are doing at desk. They
              operate in silence and will be doing impressive work behind the scenes. Yet, it will be kept secret.<br />
              They end up winning Hackathons and other coding challenges but remain un-noticed.<br />
              <br />
              The Secret developer is opposite to the Show-off developer<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #5 : The Extra activity developer</h3>
              This developer always tries to participate in team building activities and group non-technical meetups.
              The Extra activity developer spends &gt;60% of the time in performing activities that are not related to
              the job and tries to get attention from the management as a "team builder"<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #6 : The Complaining developer</h3>
              The Complaining developer starts complaining about every task given and always tries to avoid doing work.
              They sometimes start complaining about things like work-life balance, employee satisfaction etc.,<br />
              <br />
              If you come across a complaining developer, you need to realize that their career has not been that great
              and you shouldn't follow their route either.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #7 : The Compliance developer</h3>
              This developer always complies to office standards, timings, attire, and other rules and regulations.
              Their conformance to the system is so effective that management starts noticing it and will make them a
              role model to other employees.<br />
              <br />
              From wearing office Identity badge to following office hours, the compliance developer follows them
              all.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #8 : The Entrepreneur developer</h3>
              This is an interesting character. The entrepreneur developer always thinks about building a startup
              company while working in another company. They try to generate income from other sources so that one day
              they can stand on their own legs and not report to any manager.<br />
              <br />
              The Entrepreneur developers are usually very talented and can get the job done in an effective
              manner.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #9 : The Utilizer developer</h3>
              <div>
                This developer always tries to utilize other developers to get the work done and they don't help them
                when needed. They just 'use' other people for their own benefits.</div>
              <div>
                <br /></div>
              <div>
                I personally don't like this behavior and suggest you stay away from them as well.</div>
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #10 : The Noisy developer</h3>
              The Noisy developer always has a comment to say about different conversations that happen in the office
              meetings / desk. They do this to get management's attention but end up getting a tagline of "noisy".<br />
              <br />
              After a certain period of time, the management will just start ignoring them and their thoughts.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #11 : The Funny developer</h3>
              The funny developer always tries to be the joker in a group. Whether it be at the office desk or during
              lunch , they try to crack jokes to gain attention in the group. They are hilarious sometimes.<br />
              <br />
              --------------------------------------<br />
              <br />
              And the last type : These are in majority in number in any office.<br />
              <br />
              <h3>
                Type #12 : The Casual developer</h3>
              The casual developer is nothing extra ordinary, nothing funny, nothing secretive.<br />
              They just operate in silence and complete office hours, collect their paycheck and checkout from office
              after work.<br />
              <br />
              <b>Conclusion</b><br />
              So all of these types of developers are inevitable and you will encounter them as you stay in a company
              for a longer time. You will have to realize and learn to interact differently with different types of
              developers.<br />
              <br />
              Comment below if you have encountered a different type of developer in your office<br />
              <br />
              Good luck,<br />
