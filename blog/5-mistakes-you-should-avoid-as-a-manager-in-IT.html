                <h4>Dear reader,</h3>
                  <br />
                  <div>
                    Management ( whether technical or non-technical ) is an art of achieving a vision by continuously
                    collaborating and enabling a team / org to collaborate with themselves.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Management's purpose is to achieve a healthy workplace, protect the work-culture and provide
                    opportunities to the rising stars.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Sometimes, due to various circumstances, managers make few mistakes that tend to hurt the outcome of
                    the
                    vision / project and affects the achievement of targets.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you want to be a successful manager, I suggest you to avoid making the below mistakes no matter
                    what
                    the situation is. These are the reasons why employees tend to leave your team and the company
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    #1 : Always pointing your direct reports for not completing work on time.
                    " Roses are red, violets are blue.... If they ain't doing it, give them a clue "
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If your direct reports have not completed work, there is definitely a reason. Yes, it could be a
                    legit
                    reason as they could be less competent / organized. But there could also be another reason :
                    "insufficient inputs". If they ain't completing, you're responsible too.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Try to find what the root cause is and then make the decision of pointing your direct reports.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    #2 : Setting unrealistic expectations.
                    "The Horse lost the race this season...winner Porshe was the reason"
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I understand your commitments to leadership matters to you. I also understand that the business is
                    important and you are trying to get work done. But setting up unrealistic expectation from your
                    direct
                    reports will burn them out.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You cannot expect all of them to show the same level of performance. You cannot also make them work
                    day
                    and night by setting very high expectations in your 1 on 1s. This will hurt your direct reports
                    enthusiasm and they will look forward to leaving you as a result.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    #3 : Constantly asking "Is it done ?... Is it done ?... Is it done ?"
                    " He lost the fun....when he heard the words, "is it done? "
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Don't get me wrong, asking your direct reports whether they have met their daily/weekly commitment
                    is
                    needed. But if you are constantly asking them "is it done ?" every hour or so will lead to
                    frustration.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is one flavor of micro-management and I personally feel this is a very wrong way to "get things
                    done". Instead, you should get involved in the situation and try to understand "why it was not
                    done".
                    Then think about your direct report's capacity to get it done. Then make your decision whether to
                    balance the workload or to train your employee.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If nothing works out, well..... you know what to do ðŸ˜‰
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    #4 : Measuring all direct reports the same way.
                    " The Birds can fly.... but you shouldn't try "
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Few managers have a fantasy. That fantasy is to have a team of all "high performers". I call this a
                    fantasy because I have never seen a team consisting of only "high performers".
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Life ain't ticking that way jack. You got high, medium and low performers. You ain't that lucky
                    jack.
                    So
                    if you start comparing between your direct reports, they start thinking that they are measured the
                    wrong
                    way.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Perhaps, all of them ain't getting the same paycheck jack. They come from different experiences. So
                    try
                    to set your boundary of expectations different for each employee.
                    <br />
                    <br /><br />
                    <br />
                    And perhaps the most important one,
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    #5 : Not Leading by example.
                    " Mirror mirror on the wall.... Am I setting an example for them all ? "
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you want your direct reports to be like how you want them to be, you need to be the same too. If
                    you
                    are asking them to attend meetings on time, you need to attend too. If you are asking them to work
                    on
                    a
                    weekend due to a deadline, you need to show up as well.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Most importantly, if you are asking them to work hard, make sure that you also do the same.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We all have a lot of expectations in life. Often times we don't see ourselves in the mirror and ask
                    ourselves "Am I meeting their expectations too? ", "Am I setting the bar that I want them to cross?
                    ",
                    "Am I the one they are all looking forward to? "
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If the answer is a "yes", then kudos to you and your team. If not, time to grab a mirror and start
                    asking these questions.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm sure you've heard this a zillion times, but I'm going the say this anyway :
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Employees don't leave the company. They leave their managers.
                    That being said,
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Wishing all the Future Managers - Good luck.
