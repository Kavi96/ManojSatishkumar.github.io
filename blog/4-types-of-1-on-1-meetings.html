                If you are an employee or a manager, 1 on 1 meeting is very important in office life - IT company.
                <br />
                <br />
                During the 1 on 1 meeting, the participants do not only focus on the project. It is the time when the
                employee gets to express certain concerns or certain things that they want to speak but they couldn't do
                it in regular meetups.
                <br />
                <br />
                1 on 1 meeting can happen between different participants.
                <br />
                <br /> <br />
                <br />
                Types of 1 on 1 meeting:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                #1. By manager with an employee.
                <br />
                <br />
                #2. By employee with a manager.
                <br />
                <br />
                #3. Between employees at the same level in the hierarchy.
                <br />
                <br />
                #4. Between employees who belong to different teams. ( my favourite :)
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                I will explain why the above 3 meetings arise in various situations in the office below.
                <br />
                <br />
                It is very interesting to know how and why these take place in the office with / without your knowledge.
                They lead to different consequences that directly / indirectly determine your business and eventually
                your career.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                So sit back, relax and keep reading.....
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                #1. By manager with an employee.
                This type is pretty official. It is actually one of the responsibilities of the manager to conduct 1 on
                1s with their direct reports. It depends from manager to manager on when they conduct these meetings
                depending on their daily schedule.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some managers prefer to have them periodically and they schedule it on their calendars. These type of
                managers are usually very sophisticated in their workday.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some managers have the 1 on 1 meeting when they "feel like".... You guessed it. They aren't
                sophisticated.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Outcome :
                <br />
                <br />
                During the meeting, the manager will give feedback about how the employee is doing and also give them
                improvement points to work on.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some managers start with a greeting and will be positive throughout the course of the meeting. They make
                sure that the employee takes the improvement points in a positive way......Yep. These are sophisticated
                managers.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some managers take this opportunity to point out the mistakes. Which is not recommended if you want to
                have a healthy relationship and want the employee to improve in the future. [ unsophisticated ]
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                #2. By employee with a manager.
                There will be instances when an employee decides to have a 1 on 1 with the manager.
                <br />
                <br />
                This happens due to a certain issue or aspect that the employee is willing to talk to the manager
                privately. This usually is not a good sign and I will explain why this happens.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Reasons when an employee decides to have a 1 on 1 with the manager :
                <br />
                <br />
                1. The manager was not taking 1 on 1s regularly.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. The employee is facing a certain problem in the workplace.
                <br />
                <br />
                3. The employee wants to move on. ( This is unfortunate but it's the reality folks )
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Outcome:
                <br />
                <br />
                The employe will express the situation and will expect the manager to do something about it.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                #3. Between employees at the same level in the hierarchy.
                There are 2 things I want to emphasize here.
                <br />
                <br />
                Certain employees in the same team / organization will gel well together in office. Some just don't. You
                will see them arguing in code reviews and other work-related things.
                <br />
                <br />
                Eventually, they will try to have 1 on 1 with each other in the interest of the following 2 outcomes.
                <br />
                <br />
                1. To know why they have not been able to gel well and what can be done from both the ends to fix the
                problem.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. To just let each other know how they feel ( This is usually not positive and doesn't solve the
                situation. )
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                #4. Between employees who belong to different teams. ( my favourite :)
                So now we have a real situation here. 2 employees of different team / organization are willing to have 1
                on 1 with each other. As strange as it sounds, I have seen this happen in offices.
                <br />
                <br />
                The reasons are :
                <br />
                <br />
                1. Employee 1 is interested to move into a new team due to a certain dissatisfaction in the current
                team. So he is trying to consult employee 2 about how it is going on in their team.
                <br />
                <br />
                2. Real bad situations have happened between the two ( non-work related in most cases ). and one of them
                is expressing the discomfort. - ( this is a bad sign and should be avoided )
                <br />
                <br /> <br />
                <br />
                As you have probably guessed, 1 on 1 meeting plays a crucial role in your career and as a manager, one
                should not make the habit of skipping them.
                <br />
                <br />
                Alone you can walk so much, Together you can run miles.
                Good luck to the future managers.
