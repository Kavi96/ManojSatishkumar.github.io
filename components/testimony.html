          Manoj is a very interesting personality, from the day one he started in GRL to till today, he keeps surprising
          me with his enthusiasm and interest to acquire new skill/knowledge. I let him go from our team to support his

          Manoj's great collaboration with product team and UX team helped to bring lots of ideas to the product. After
          he joined, demo's are no longer boring PPTs and plain walkthrough. Watching his demo is like watching an
          interesting short film. He broke lots of such old conventions in team.
